step 1:Make a folder 

step 2:
save file as server.py and copy this in itimport socket

def start_server():
    # Step 1: Create UDP socket
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

    # Step 2: Bind server to localhost and port 5001
    server_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 5001))
    print("UDP Server is up and listening on port 5001...")

    # Step 3: Receive file name from client
    filename, client_addr = server_socket.recvfrom(1024)
    filename = filename.decode()
    print(f"Receiving file: {filename} from {client_addr}")

    # Step 4: Open file to write received data

    # Close the socket
    server_socket.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":

step 2:
save one more file as client.py

    server_ip = input("Enter server IP address: ")
    filename = input("Enter the file name to send: ")

    # Step 1: Create UDP socket
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    server_address = (server_ip, 5001)

    # Step 2: Send file name first
    client_socket.sendto(filename.encode(), server_address)

    # Step 3: Read file in binary mode and send in chunks
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
            while True:
                bytes_read = f.read(4096)

        client_socket.sendto(b'EOF', server_address)
        print("File sent successfully.")
    else:
        print("File not found!")

    # Step 4: Receive confirmation from server
    msg, _ = client_socket.recvfrom(1024)
    print("Server response:", msg.decode())

    client_socket.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_client()

step 3:save a text file as udp.txt in same folder

step 4:open cmd change the path to servers file path after changing put this "python server.py"
output:
"UDP Server is up and listening on port 5001..."

step 5 :open cmd again change path to client file path and then put "python client.py"
output:
Enter server IP address: 127.0.0.1
Enter the file name to send: udp.txt
File sent successfully.
Server response: File received successfully.

step 6: again check server cmd it will show this nowUDP Server is up and listening on port 5001...
Receiving file: udp.txt from ('127.0.0.1', 59596)
File 'udp.txt' received successfully and saved as 'received_udp.txt'











full code and steps


yeh UDP-based file transfer program hai — jisme server file receive karta hai aur client file send karta hai.
Same folder me server.py, client.py, aur udp.txt file rakho.

🟩 udp.txt

ek simple text file banao same folder me jisme kuch likh do, for example:

This is a UDP file transfer test.

🟩 Execution Steps
Step 1️⃣:

Server start karo

python server.py


Output:

UDP Server is up and listening on port 5001...

Step 2️⃣:

Client run karo (dusre CMD window me)

python client.py


Input & Output:

Enter server IP address: 127.0.0.1
Enter the file name to send: udp.txt
File sent successfully.
Server response: File received successfully.

Step 3️⃣:

Server CMD me ab ye dikhai dega:

UDP Server is up and listening on port 5001...
Receiving file: udp.txt from ('127.0.0.1', 59596)
File 'udp.txt' received successfully and saved as 'received_udp.txt'


✅ Result:
Server folder me ek new file received_udp.txt ban jaayegi — jisme same data hoga jo udp.txt me tha.


















questions:

6. UDP Socket Program for File Transfer
Q1. What is UDP?

Hindi-English: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) ek fast, connectionless protocol hai.
English: UDP is a fast, connectionless protocol.

Q2. How is UDP different from TCP?

Hindi-English: UDP me connection nahi banta aur reliability kam hoti hai.
English: UDP doesn’t establish a connection and is less reliable than TCP.

Q3. What is meant by connectionless service?

Hindi-English: Data bina connection ke bheja jata hai.
English: Data is sent without establishing a connection.

Q4. Is UDP reliable? Why or why not?

Hindi-English: Nahi, kyunki error checking aur acknowledgment nahi hota.
English: No, because it lacks acknowledgment and error recovery.

Q5. Real-life examples of UDP?

Hindi-English: Video streaming, VoIP, online gaming.
English: Used in video streaming, VoIP, gaming.

Q6. What functions are used for UDP communication?

Hindi-English: socket(), sendto(), recvfrom(), bind().
English: socket(), sendto(), recvfrom(), bind().

Q7. How do you send and receive files using UDP?

Hindi-English: Client file ko chunks me send karta hai aur server recvfrom() se receive karta hai.
English: Client sends file chunks; server receives with recvfrom().

Q8. What types of files can be transferred?

Hindi-English: Text, image, or any binary file.
English: Text, image, or any binary files.

Q9. What happens if a packet is lost in UDP?

Hindi-English: Packet resend nahi hota; data loss hota hai.
English: Lost packets are not retransmitted, causing data loss.

Q10. Why is UDP preferred for audio/video transfer?

Hindi-English: Kyunki fast hai aur thoda packet loss acceptable hai.
English: It’s faster, and small packet loss doesn’t affect real-time media.
