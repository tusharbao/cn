step 1:make one folder

step 2:server.py file in the folder 

import socket

def receive_file():
    # Create TCP socket
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    print("File received successfully.")
    conn.close()
    server_socket.close()

# Run the server

step 3:same client.py in same folder

import socket

    server_hello = client_socket.recv(1024).decode() 
    print(f"Server says: {server_hello}")

    # Step 2: Send file name 
    filename = file_path.split('/')[-1]

    print("File sent successfully.")
    client_socket.close()

# Run the client 
send_file("test.txt")  # Make sure test.txt exists

step 4:save test.txt file in same folder

step 5:open cmd change the path to server file  path and paste this "python server.py"
//output:Server listening on port 5001...
 
Connection from ('127.0.0.1', 56789)
Client says: Hello from Client!
Receiving file: test.txt
File received successfully.



step 6: again open cmd change the path to client file path and paste this"python client.py"
//Server says: Hello from Server!
File sent successfully.















''' questions:

1. What is a socket?

Hindi-English: Socket ek connection point hota hai jahan client aur server ke beech communication hoti hai.
English: A socket is an endpoint that allows communication between client and server programs over a network.

2. What is TCP?

Hindi-English: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ek reliable connection-oriented protocol hai jo data ko sahi order me deliver karta hai.
English: TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered data transmission.

3. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

Hindi-English:

TCP: Reliable, connection-based, slow but accurate.

UDP: Unreliable, connectionless, fast but may lose data.
English:
TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery, while UDP is faster but doesn’t guarantee delivery or order.

4. Which layer uses TCP?

Hindi-English: TCP Transport Layer me use hota hai (OSI model ke 4th layer me).
English: TCP works at the Transport Layer of the OSI model.

5. What are the functions of socket(), bind(), listen(), and accept()?

Hindi-English:

socket(): Naya socket (connection endpoint) create karta hai.

bind(): Socket ko ek specific IP aur port se connect karta hai.

listen(): Server ko client requests sunne ke mode me daal deta hai.

accept(): Client connection ko accept karta hai aur data exchange start hota hai.
English:

socket(): Creates a new socket.

bind(): Binds socket to IP and port.

listen(): Puts server in listening mode.

accept(): Accepts a client connection.

6. What is a client and a server in a socket program?

Hindi-English:

Server: Jo wait karta hai aur data receive karta hai.

Client: Jo connection initiate karta hai aur data send karta hai.
English:

Server waits for requests and receives data.

Client initiates connection and sends data.

7. How does TCP ensure reliable data transfer?

Hindi-English: TCP data ko packets me bhejta hai, har packet ka acknowledgment leta hai, aur agar packet lost ho jaye to resend karta hai.
English: TCP ensures reliability using acknowledgments, retransmission, and sequencing of data packets.

8. What is a port number?

Hindi-English: Port number ek unique number hota hai jo system me running service ko identify karta hai, jaise 5001.
English: A port number identifies a specific process or service on a networked system.

9. What is the output of the “Say Hello” program?

Hindi-English:

Server side:

Server listening on port 5001...
Connection from ('127.0.0.1', 56789)
Client says: Hello from Client!
Receiving file: test.txt
File received successfully.


Client side:

Server says: Hello from Server!
File sent successfully.


English:
The server receives a greeting and the file; the client sends a greeting and confirms file sent successfully.

10. How is file transfer verified?

Hindi-English: Jab file receive hoti hai to server ek nayi file save karta hai jiska naam received_test.txt hota hai — agar wo file folder me mil jaye to transfer successful hai.
English: File transfer is verified by checking the new file (received_test.txt) created on the server side.'''
