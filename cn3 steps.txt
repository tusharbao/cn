Step 1: Wired LAN (LAN1) Setup Kare

Cisco Packet Tracer open kare.

Devices drag kare:

1 Layer 2 Switch (2960)

2 PCs

Cables connect kare (Copper Straight-Through):

PC1 FastEthernet0 → Switch FastEthernet0/1

PC2 FastEthernet0 → Switch FastEthernet0/2

Step 2: Wireless LAN (LAN2) Setup Kare

Wireless Router drag kare (jaise Linksys WRT300N)

Laptops drag kare: 2 Laptops

Wireless Router Configure kare:

GUI ya Config tab → SSID set kare (e.g., WirelessLAN)

DHCP enable kare → Wireless clients ko automatic IP assign hoga

Wireless Security set kare (e.g., WPA2 Personal) aur Password define kare

Laptops Configure kare:

Laptop1 → Desktop → PC Wireless → Connect → WirelessLAN → Password enter kare

Laptop2 ke liye bhi same process repeat kare

Step 3: Wired aur Wireless LAN Ko Interconnect Kare

Router drag kare (jaise 1841 ya 2911)

Wired LAN → Router connect kare:

Switch FastEthernet0/24 → Router FastEthernet0/0 (Copper Straight-Through)

Wireless Router → Router connect kare:

Wireless Router Internet port → Router FastEthernet0/1 (Copper Straight-Through)

Step 4: IP Addresses Configure Kare

Router Interfaces configure kare:

FastEthernet0/0 (Wired LAN): 192.168.1.1/24

FastEthernet0/1 (Wireless LAN): 192.168.2.1/24

Static IP assign kare Wired PCs ko:

PC1: 192.168.1.2, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

PC2: 192.168.1.3, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Wireless Laptops → DHCP se automatic IP assign hoga (192.168.2.x) aur Default Gateway 192.168.2.1

Step 5: Router Me Routing Configure Kare

Router CLI open kare → Enable mode me jaye:

enable
configure terminal


Interfaces configure kare:

interface FastEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit
interface FastEthernet0/1
 ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit
end


Ye ensure karta hai ki Wired LAN aur Wireless LAN ke beech communication ho.

Step 6: Connectivity Test Using PING

PC1 (Wired LAN) → Command Prompt → ping Laptop1 IP:

ping 192.168.2.x


Laptop1 (Wireless LAN) → Command Prompt → ping PC1 IP:

ping 192.168.1.2


✅ Dono directions me successful reply aana chahiye → Communication sahi hai

Step 7: Packet Transfer Demonstration in Simulation Mode

Packet Tracer me Simulation Mode activate kare → Stopwatch icon

PC1 → Laptop1 ko ping bheje

Simulation window me packets ka flow observe kare:

Packets Wired LAN → Router → Wireless LAN → Laptop1 tak travel karte hain

Packets pe click kare → Detailed journey dekhe, including Source, Destination aur Routing path
