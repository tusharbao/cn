Step 1: Network Topology Create Kare

Cisco Packet Tracer open kare.

Devices drag kare:

1 Layer 2 Switch (jaise 2960)

2 PCs (Client PCs)

Cables connect kare (Copper Straight-Through):

PC1 FastEthernet0 → Switch FastEthernet0/1

PC2 FastEthernet0 → Switch FastEthernet0/2

Step 2: PCs Ko IP Address Assign Kare

PC1 select kare → Desktop tab → IP Configuration → Assign kare:

IP Address: 192.168.1.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

PC2 ke liye:

IP Address: 192.168.1.3

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Step 3: Connectivity Test Kare (PING)

PC1 → Desktop tab → Command Prompt open kare

Command type kare:

ping 192.168.1.3


Agar network sahi hai, to output aayega:

Reply from 192.168.1.3


Ye confirm karta hai ki PCs successfully communicate kar rahe hain.

Step 4: Packet Capture Using Simulation Mode

Simulation Mode activate kare → Bottom-right corner me Stopwatch icon click kare

PC1 → Command Prompt → fir se type kare:

ping 192.168.1.3


Simulation window me packets observe kare:

Aapko ICMP Echo Request aur Echo Reply packets dikhenge

Packet ke journey (source → destination) bhi dekhi ja sakti hai

Step 5: Packet Details Analyze Kare

Simulation panel → Event List me click kare

Kisi packet pe click kare → Details pane me dekhe:

ICMP Echo Request → PC1 se PC2 ko bheja gaya

ICMP Echo Reply → PC2 se PC1 ko return hua

Source IP & Destination IP clearly visible hote hain

Isse aapko pata chalta hai ki network ke andar packets kaise travel karte hain
















Step 1: Create Network Topology in Packet Tracer 
•
 •
 •
 • 
Step 1.1: Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
 Step 1.2: Drag a Layer 2 Switch (e.g., 2960) into the workspace.
 Step 1.3: Drag 2 PCs into the workspace.
 Step 1.4: Use Copper Straight-Through cables to connect each PC to the switch: 
o
 o 
Connect PC1's FastEthernet0 to Switch0's FastEthernet0/1.
 Connect PC2's FastEthernet0 to Switch0's FastEthernet0/2. 
Step 2: Assign IP Addresses to PCs 
•
 • 
Step 2.1: Click on PC1, go to the Desktop tab, and select IP Configuration.
 Step 2.2: Assign the following IP details: 
o IP Address: 192.168.1.2 
o Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 
• Step 2.3: Do the same for PC2 and assign: 
o IP Address: 192.168.1.3 
o Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 
Step 3: Test Connectivity Using PING Utility 
•
 • 
Code:
 Step 3.1: Click on PC1, open the Command Prompt from the Desktop tab.
 Step 3.2: Test the connection by typing: 
ping 192.168.1.3 
o You should receive Reply from 192.168.1.3 confirming successful communication. 
Step 4: Capture Ping Packets Using Simulation Mode in Packet Tracer 
•
 • 
Code:
 Step 4.1: Switch to Simulation Mode by clicking the Stopwatch icon in the bottom-right corner.
 Step 4.2: Click on PC1 and go to the Command Prompt. Again, type: 
ping 192.168.1.3 
•
 • 
Step 4.3: Observe the packets being sent across the network in the simulation window.
 Step 4.4: Click on any ICMP packet to view details such as Source, Destination, and the packet journey. 
Step 5: Analysing Packet Details 
•
 • 
Step 5.1: After the packet is captured, click on the Event List in the Simulation panel.
 Step 5.2: Click on any of the packets in the list to see the detailed information, including: 
o ICMP Echo Request
 o ICMP Echo Reply 
o Source and Destination IPs
